## About The Project

<!-- Use relative path to reference images you want to use in the README -->
[![Screenshot](images/example.jpg?raw=true "Project Title")](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this one. The aim is to have a reusable and consistent README template for portfolio projects that will clearly showcase what you have built.

I would say this template is the minimal version of <a href="https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template">this one.</a> While I like that template, I believe there are parts not really needed for portfolio projects so I removed them.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. Feel free to modify this template to your needs and/or suggest me improvements via forking and issues.

Hope you will find it helpful. Use the `README_TEMPLATE.md` to get started.
